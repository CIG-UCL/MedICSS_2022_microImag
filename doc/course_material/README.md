# How to use these scripts
1. You should read the comments in the script.
2. There are some questions through the script, write your answer into the
   dedicated space. Don't worry if you don't know the answer, you are
   here to learn!!
3. The code is divided in sections. Every time you start a new section you
   should uncomment the code and complete the missing parts (which are
   highlighted). Then run the section code and go to the next section.
4. Repeat step 3. until the end of the script.
