# Estimation of brain tissue microstructure with dMRI

## Purpose

This folder contains the material for "Estimation of brain tissue microstructure with dMRI" course of the 2022 UCL Medical Image Computing Summer School (MedICSS).

## Project aim

The aim of this project is to explore different approaches of estimating brain tissue microstructure parameters from diffusion MRI data.
If you want to know more you can have a look at the introductoy slides available in this folder ().
