# Estimation of brain tissue microstructure with dMRI

## Purpose

This folder contains the material for "Estimation of brain tissue microstructure with dMRI" course of the 2022 UCL Medical Image Computing Summer School (MedICSS).

## Project aim

The aim of this project is to explore different approaches of estimating brain tissue microstructure parameters from diffusion MRI data.

If you want to know more you can have a look at the introductoy slides available [here]().

## Prerequisite

We will use [MATLAB](https://uk.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) throughout the entire course, so make sure to have it installed on you computer.

### MATLAB ad-on toolboxes

You will need to have the following ad-on toolboxes installed on your MATLAB:

* **Optimization** toolbox.

* **Deep Learning Toolbox**.

* **Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox**.

You can check the ad-ond currently installed on your MATLAB as well as donwload the missing ones simply from your MATLAB main window. Check [here]() for a visual tutorial.

### MATLAB toolboxes

You will also need to Download the following toolboxes:

* The [NODDI MATLAB toolbox](http://mig.cs.ucl.ac.uk/index.php?n=Download.NODDI).

* The [NIfTI Matlab library](https://github.com/NIFTI-Imaging/nifti_matlab).

* The [NifTI Matlab tools](https://uk.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/8797-tools-for-nifti-and-analyze-image).

After the download you should keep track of the path to the folder where they are located.

Suggestion: creat a folder

## Download the GitHub folder

The best way to install this GitHub folder is directly from your MATLAB main window using a simple GUI.  You can find the process illustrated by the following set of screenshots: [step1](figs/installation/matlabGitRetrieval1.png), [step2](figs/installation/matlabGitRetrieval2.png), [step3](figs/installation/matlabGitRetrieval3.png). The documentation of this functionality is available [here](https://it.mathworks.com/help/simulink/ug/clone-git-repository.html).

Otherwise you can download a zip version of the repository or use the following command from terminal:

```
git clone 
```
